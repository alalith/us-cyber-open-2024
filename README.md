# What is this?

This is a repository of all the CTF challenges I completed/attempted during the [Season 4 US Cyber Games Open](https://www.uscybergames.com/). The Open is used to determine who is skilled enough to be placed onto the Season 4 US Cyber Games team. 

Was a fun CTF, challenges had good difficulty scaling. Most challenges in the repo were completed, I am too lazy to track down which ones weren't.
