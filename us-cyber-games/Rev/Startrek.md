## Creating the spaceship structure

We start by executing the binary and seeing what it outputs:
```
âžœ  startrek ./startrek 
Captains Kirk and Spock both begin in Galaxy 000. Their ships' fuel levels are both at 100%.  Good luck!  If you help the Captains accomplish their mission, you will surely Live Long and Prosper!

Starship: 1	Current Galaxy: 000	Jumps Remaining: 5
Preparing the ship for the next jump...
Do you want to tell the Captain to alter his trajectory (y/n)? 
n
Jumped 2 galaxies and landed on 002

Starship: 2	Current Galaxy: 000	Jumps Remaining: 5
Preparing the ship for the next jump...
Do you want to tell the Captain to alter his trajectory (y/n)? 
```

We see that there are two ships, they both start at galaxy 0, and start with 5 jumps. Now let's open the binary in ghidra to get a better idea of what's going on under the hood. In the beginning there is the following block of code:
```C
  for (local_3e4 = 0; (int)local_3e4 < local_68; local_3e4 = local_3e4 + 1) {
    *(uint *)(local_3a8 + (long)(int)local_3e4 * 0x20) = local_3e4 + 1;
    *(undefined4 *)(local_3a8 + (long)(int)local_3e4 * 0x20 + 4) = 0;
    *(int *)(local_3a8 + (long)(int)local_3e4 * 0x20 + 8) = local_6c;
    *(undefined4 *)(local_3a8 + (long)(int)local_3e4 * 0x20 + 0xc) = 0;
    lVar13 = (long)local_6c;
    *(undefined8 *)(puVar14 + -0x48) = 0x1015f9;
    pvVar11 = malloc(lVar13 << 2);
    *(void **)(local_3a8 + (long)(int)local_3e4 * 0x20 + 0x10) = pvVar11;
    lVar13 = (long)local_6c;
    *(undefined8 *)(puVar14 + -0x48) = 0x10162a;
    pvVar11 = malloc(lVar13 << 2);
    *(void **)(local_3a8 + (long)(int)local_3e4 * 0x20 + 0x18) = pvVar11;
  }
```

This seems to be the initialization of the spaceships, based on the fact that `local_68` is 2, and `local_6c` is 5, matching with the number of spaceships and the amount of jumps each ship starts with. Based on the decompilation, we can tell that `local_3e4` seems to be an array that holds two copies of a structure for spaceships. Based on the initialization of each variable we can determine the size from the following lines:
```C
    *(uint *)(local_3a8 + (long)(int)local_3e4 * 0x20) = local_3e4 + 1;
    *(undefined4 *)(local_3a8 + (long)(int)local_3e4 * 0x20 + 4) = 0;
    *(int *)(local_3a8 + (long)(int)local_3e4 * 0x20 + 8) = local_6c;
    *(undefined4 *)(local_3a8 + (long)(int)local_3e4 * 0x20 + 0xc) = 0;
    *(void **)(local_3a8 + (long)(int)local_3e4 * 0x20 + 0x10) = pvVar11;
	*(void **)(local_3a8 + (long)(int)local_3e4 * 0x20 + 0x18) = pvVar11;
```

We can see that the first four variables are a 4 byte long integer, while the last two variables are pointers

We create the following structure in ghidra based on the sizes in the structure and name the ones we know so far:
![[Pasted image 20240723115942.png]]

We now retype `local_3a8` to `spaceship *` and do some variable renaming and the initialization code block ends up looking like this:
```C
  for (curr_spaceship = 0; curr_spaceship < local_68; curr_spaceship = curr_spaceship + 1) {
    spaceships[curr_spaceship].spaceship_num = curr_spaceship + 1;
    spaceships[curr_spaceship].field1_0x4 = 0;
    spaceships[curr_spaceship].jumps_remaining = local_6c;
    spaceships[curr_spaceship].field3_0xc = 0;
    lVar13 = (long)local_6c;
    *(undefined8 *)(puVar14 + -0x48) = 0x1015f9;
    piVar11 = (int *)malloc(lVar13 << 2);
    spaceships[curr_spaceship].field4_0x10 = piVar11;
    lVar13 = (long)local_6c;
    *(undefined8 *)(puVar14 + -0x48) = 0x10162a;
    piVar11 = (int *)malloc(lVar13 << 2);
    spaceships[curr_spaceship].field5_0x18 = piVar11;
  }
```

This looks way cleaner, now we need to determine what the other fields do. To do this, we look at other places in the code. We find a `jump` function that takes in the currently selected spaceship. Let's go ahead and retype and rename this parameter for the function and take a look at it:
```C
void jump(spaceship *spaceship,uint param_2,long param_3)

{
  uint uVar1;
  uint local_10;
  
  if (((int)param_2 < 7) && (0 < (int)param_2)) {
    uVar1 = param_2 + spaceship->field1_0x4;
    printf("Jumped %d galaxies and landed on %03d\n",(ulong)param_2,(ulong)uVar1);
    if (*(int *)(param_3 + (long)(int)uVar1 * 4) == 0) {
      local_10 = uVar1;
      if (*(int *)(param_3 + 4 + ((long)(int)uVar1 + 100) * 4) != 0) {
        local_10 = *(uint *)(param_3 + 4 + ((long)(int)uVar1 + 100) * 4);
        *(undefined4 *)(param_3 + 4 + ((long)(int)uVar1 + 100) * 4) = 0;
        printf("This galaxy contained a wormhole, you were teleported to galaxy %03d.\n",
               (ulong)local_10);
      }
    }
    else {
      local_10 = *(uint *)(param_3 + (long)(int)uVar1 * 4);
      *(undefined4 *)(param_3 + (long)(int)uVar1 * 4) = 0;
      printf("This galaxy contained a slipstream, you were teleported to galaxy %03d.\n",
             (ulong)local_10);
    }
    spaceship->field1_0x4 = local_10;
  }
  else {
    puts("Impossible trajectory! Are your instruments calibrated??\nYou have just wasted fuel.");
  }
  spaceship->jumps_remaining = spaceship->jumps_remaining + -1;
  return;
}
```

It looks like `param_3` seems to be another structure, as the decompilation is calculating offsets similar to code block we analyzed earlier. We will take a closer look at that later, let's focus on changes to the `spaceship *` structure. Based on the `printf` statements, we can see that `local_10` is the galaxy number you end up on, which is then set at `spaceship->field0x4`. So we can determine that `field1_0x4` is the `current_galaxy`. The very first `printf` also tells us that `param_2` is the number of galaxies jumped. Let's rename our variables accordingly.

Let's jump back to `main` and see what happens after the call to `jump`:
```C
jump(psVar1,uVar9,(long)local_398);       spaceships[curr_spaceship].field4_0x10[spaceships[curr_spaceship].jumps_remaining] = local_3e0;
        spaceships[curr_spaceship].field5_0x18[spaceships[curr_spaceship].jumps_remaining] = spaceships[curr_spaceship].current_galaxy;
if (local_70 <= spaceships[curr_spaceship].current_galaxy) {
    spaceships[curr_spaceship].jumps_remaining = 0;
    spaceships[curr_spaceship].field3_0xc = -0x45522ff3;
}
```

We notice that `field4` and `field5` are both arrays indexed by the number of jumps we have remaining. We also see that `field4` stores `local_3e0`, which is a random number from 1-6 that ends up being the amount of distance we traveled. `field5` seems to be the path of galaxies we've traveled.  We'll rename `field` to `distancesPath` and `field5` to `galaxyPath`

`field3` is set when the spaceships `current_galaxy` is greater than or equal to `local_70`, which is 100. If we look a couple lines down:
```C
  for (curr_spaceship = 0; curr_spaceship < local_68; curr_spaceship = curr_spaceship + 1) {
    if (spaceships[curr_spaceship].field3_0xc != 0) {
      local_3d8 = local_3d8 + 1;
    }
  }
  if (local_3d8 == local_68) {
    *(undefined8 *)(puVar13 + -0x48) = 0x101ae7;
    puts(
        "The Architects are impressed by your Space Navigation skills. They have deemed Kirk and Spock worthy of the Quantum Key!"
        );
...
```

We see that we need `field3` to be set to a non-zero number for both spaceships in order to get the "Quantum Key". This means that we probably want both spaceships to reach 100. We'll rename `field3` to `reachedEnd`. 

In the end we get a `spaceship` struct as such:
![[Pasted image 20240723123611.png]]
## Finding where the key is stored

The code past the `puts` seems to do alot of manipulations to `local_58` on `field4` and `field5` of our spaceships structures. `local_58` is likely where the flag is stored, so we will have to put a breakpoint at the end of this code block. One piece of code is interesting in this code block:
```C
    for (curr_spaceship = 0; curr_spaceship < 6; curr_spaceship = curr_spaceship + 1) {
      (&local_58)[curr_spaceship] = (&local_58)[curr_spaceship] ^ local_3c8;
    }
```

This tells us that `local_58` is an array of 6 elements. Based on other code in the code block also seems to imply that it is a `ulong`, so we can retype and rename the variable as `ulong[6] flag`

## Finding the starmap

Let's go back to the `jump` function and take a closer look at how `param_3` is used, which persume to be our starmap:
```C
    if (*(int *)(param_3 + (long)(int)uVar1 * 4) == 0) {
      local_10 = uVar1;
      if (*(int *)(param_3 + 4 + ((long)(int)uVar1 + 100) * 4) != 0) {
        local_10 = *(uint *)(param_3 + 4 + ((long)(int)uVar1 + 100) * 4);
        *(undefined4 *)(param_3 + 4 + ((long)(int)uVar1 + 100) * 4) = 0;
        printf("This galaxy contained a wormhole, you were teleported to galaxy %03d.\n",
               (ulong)local_10);
      }
    }
    else {
      local_10 = *(uint *)(param_3 + (long)(int)uVar1 * 4);
      *(undefined4 *)(param_3 + (long)(int)uVar1 * 4) = 0;
      printf("This galaxy contained a slipstream, you were teleported to galaxy %03d.\n",
             (ulong)local_10);
    }
```

We notice the offset calculation being used similar to what was happening for the `spaceship` struct. It looks like there are two `int` arrays, one that is an `int[100]` and the other of unknown length. It looks like that the `starmap` will check the first array to see if there is a galaxy to teleport to, and if there isn't will check the second array as a backup. Once a value in the `starmap` is used, the value is set to 0, meaning that wormhole/slipstream can't be used again. We can assume the second array is also `int[100]` since the end goal is to reach galaxy 100 anyways. We end up creating a struct like this:
![[Pasted image 20240723124340.png]]

We retype and rename `param_3` in the `jump function` and now our code block looks like this:
```C
    if (starmap->starmap1[uVar1] == 0) {
      local_10 = uVar1;
      if (starmap->starmap2[(long)uVar1 + 1] != 0) {
        local_10 = starmap->starmap2[(long)uVar1 + 1];
        starmap->starmap2[(long)uVar1 + 1] = 0;
        printf("This galaxy contained a wormhole, you were teleported to galaxy %03d.\n",
               (ulong)local_10);
      }
    }
    else {
      local_10 = starmap->starmap1[uVar1];
      starmap->starmap1[uVar1] = 0;
      printf("This galaxy contained a slipstream, you were teleported to galaxy %03d.\n",
             (ulong)local_10);
    }
```

This looks much cleaner and allows us to have a better understanding of what's going on. One thing to note is that `starmap2` actually increases the index by 1, so we need to adjust `starmap2` to be a `int[101]` This is our final `starmap` struct:
![[Pasted image 20240723124606.png]]

Now let's go back to main and retype the variable that's the third argument in the call to `jump` as `starmap`. Now if we look at the beginning of the `main` function we see our starmap:
```C
  starmap.starmap1[70] = 0x5b;
  starmap.starmap1[5] = 0xf;
  starmap.starmap1[19] = 0x29;
  starmap.starmap1[4] = 0x4b;
  starmap.starmap1[28] = 0x32;
  starmap.starmap1[35] = 0x60;
  starmap.starmap1[44] = 0x52;
  starmap.starmap1[53] = 0x5e;
  starmap.starmap1[59] = 0x5f;
  starmap.starmap2[99] = 0xc;
  starmap.starmap2[89] = 0x43;
  starmap.starmap2[82] = 0x3e;
  starmap.starmap2[77] = 0x29;
  starmap.starmap2[53] = 0x17;
  starmap.starmap2[48] = 0x1e;
  starmap.starmap2[32] = 8;
  starmap.starmap2[22] = 3;
```

Now we have our full `starmap` and `spaceship` struct figured out. Now we just need to control our movement so that we can get to 100 in 5 jumps.

## Controlling movement
The following two lines control the distance our spaceships go:
```C
        rand_num = rand();
        distance_traveled = rand_num % 6 + 1;
```

`rand()` is a C function that we can overwrite with `LD_PRELOAD`. The following C code can be compiled into an `.so` file to control the numbers called by rand:
```C
#include<stdio.h>

int i = 0;
int fake_rand[] = {1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1};

int rand() {
	return fake_rand[i++]-1;
}
```

If we compile this and then hook rand with `LD_PRELOAD` we see that the spaceships only ever jump 1 galaxy every time:
```
âžœ  startrek LD_PRELOAD=./test.so ./startrek
Captains Kirk and Spock both begin in Galaxy 000. Their ships' fuel levels are both at 100%.  Good luck!  If you help the Captains accomplish their mission, you will surely Live Long and Prosper!

Starship: 1	Current Galaxy: 000	Jumps Remaining: 5
Preparing the ship for the next jump...
Do you want to tell the Captain to alter his trajectory (y/n)? 
n
Jumped 1 galaxies and landed on 001

Starship: 2	Current Galaxy: 000	Jumps Remaining: 5
Preparing the ship for the next jump...
n
n
n
n
Do you want to tell the Captain to alter his trajectory (y/n)? 
Jumped 1 galaxies and landed on 001

Starship: 1	Current Galaxy: 001	Jumps Remaining: 4
Preparing the ship for the next jump...
n
Do you want to tell the Captain to alter his trajectory (y/n)? 
Jumped 1 galaxies and landed on 002

Starship: 2	Current Galaxy: 001	Jumps Remaining: 4
Preparing the ship for the next jump...
Do you want to tell the Captain to alter his trajectory (y/n)? 
Jumped 1 galaxies and landed on 002
```

## Finding the Path

By trial and error, the correct path for both spaceship 1 and 2 were found. `Startrek2` goes over finding the shortest path algorithmically. The paths are so:
```
spaceship1:
0  +5 5 = 15
15 +4 19 = 41
41 +6 47 = 30
30 +5 35 = 96
96 +4 101 = 100



spaceship2:
0 +4 4 = 75
75 +1 76 = 41
41 +6 47 = 47
47 +6 53 = 94
94 +6 100= 100
```

In order to make these jumps our `.so` code needs to be modified to following:
```
#include<stdio.h>

int i = 0;
int fake_rand[] = {5,4,4,1,6,6,5,6,4,6};
int rand() {
	return fake_rand[i++]-1;
}
```

We run the code with `LD_PRELOAD` and get the success message, however the program promptly exits:
```
...
Starship: 1	Current Galaxy: 096	Jumps Remaining: 1
Preparing the ship for the next jump...
Do you want to tell the Captain to alter his trajectory (y/n)? 
Jumped 4 galaxies and landed on 100

Starship: 2	Current Galaxy: 094	Jumps Remaining: 1
Preparing the ship for the next jump...
Do you want to tell the Captain to alter his trajectory (y/n)? 
Jumped 6 galaxies and landed on 100
The Architects are impressed by your Space Navigation skills. They have deemed Kirk and Spock worthy of the Quantum Key!
```

## Getting the flag

While the flag is generated in memory, it is not actually printed out. We will need to use gdb to break right before the program exits and dump the flag from memory. We break at `*main+2640` as the `jmp` right after all the flag manipulation is done. The flag is stored in `rbp-0x50` so we can just print out the string that sits there:
```C
gefâž¤  x/s $rbp-0x50
0x7fffffffdc70:	"****USCGSIV{148c1252d_U_so1ved_it@Warp_Sp33d}***"
```

## Flag

`USCGSIV{148c1252d_U_so1ved_it@Warp_Sp33d}`


# Startrek2
## Adjusting for differences

The folllowing changes are different from `startrek1` to `startrek2`:
- Spaceships are given 8 jumps instead of 5
- Spaceships can jump anywhere from 1-8 galaxies vs the previous 1-6
- There is the option for a ship-to-ship fuel transfer in the beginning, allowing one ship to go farther at the cost of the other one going shorter
- The end goal is galaxy 1600 instead of galaxy 100
- The `spaceship` struct has an extra `int` in it's structure which is related to the fuel transfer

Let's update our structs so that they account for these differences.

`spaceship`:
![[Pasted image 20240723131339.png]]

`starmap`:
![[Pasted image 20240723131404.png]]

Updating the `starmap` struct reveals the full starmap at the top of the `main function`:
```C
  starmap.starmap1[8] = 0xce;
  starmap.starmap1[2] = 0xb5;
  starmap.starmap1[410] = 0x590;
  starmap.starmap1[1479] = 0x62c;
  starmap.starmap1[1556] = 0x633;
  starmap.starmap1[1287] = 0x565;
  starmap.starmap1[1006] = 0x621;
  starmap.starmap1[369] = 400;
  starmap.starmap1[1426] = 0x639;
  starmap.starmap1[208] = 0x324;
  starmap.starmap1[884] = 0x5dd;
  starmap.starmap1[897] = 0x619;
  starmap.starmap1[561] = 0x4f6;
  starmap.starmap1[1422] = 0x600;
  starmap.starmap1[160] = 0x4db;
  starmap.starmap1[209] = 0x3b1;
  starmap.starmap1[717] = 0x3dd;
  starmap.starmap1[606] = 0x3e5;
  starmap.starmap1[18] = 0x55a;
  starmap.starmap1[981] = 0x59c;
  starmap.starmap1[280] = 0x518;
...many more lines of starmap defintions
```

In order to determine the correct path, we can no longer use trial and error as the starmap is simply too long. We will have to find a way to solve the star map algorithmically.

## Finding optimal paths

The following python script uses a modified version of bfs to determine the optimal paths for both spaceships to take, based on the starmap in the program:
```python

When traversing the graph, we store the current index, plus the increment that was used to get there. This allows us to see exactly what distances we need the spaceships to travel to get to the end. We also store the current state of the starmaps, since we need to close the portal so that it can't be used again just like the code does. After our first run through of  the algorithm, we get the end state of the starmaps and then run the algorithm again to determine the path for the second ship. Running this code we get the following:
```
fuel required: 6
0 +0
206 +8
945 +3
287 +7
1192 +4
1592 +8
1600 +8
fuel required: 10
0 +0
8 +8
1308 +8
94 +4
43 +3
51 +8
59 +8
791 +8
1178 +2
1598 +5
1600 +2
```

We see that both ships get to 1600, and that the fuel required adds up to 16, the total amount of fuel we have to work with.

## Getting the flag

We modify our `.so` file with the distances we found, so that we can control `rand()` and get both ships to the end. The result `.so` file is as so:
```C
#include<stdio.h>

int i = 0;
int fake_rand[] = {8,8,3,8,7,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,5,2};

int rand() {
	return fake_rand[i++]-1;
}
```

Now let's open the program in gdb with `LD_PRELOAD` set, and right before the exit at `*main+5651`. We'll transfer 2 fuel cells to the second ship and then type `n` until both spaceships reach the end. Eventually we hit the breakpoint and we need to dump the flag from memory which is at `rbp-0x70`. We do this and get the flag:
```C
gefâž¤  x/s $rbp-0x70
0x7fffffffdc40:	"~USCGSIV{77ad9e80_C31e5tia1_NaV7g@t1On...Check!}"
```

## Flag

`USCGSIV{77ad9e80_C31e5tia1_NaV7g@t1On...Check!}`
